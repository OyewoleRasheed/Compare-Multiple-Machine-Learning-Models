# 🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction - Model Comparison

This project demonstrates how to **train and compare multiple machine learning models** for a **regression problem** using real estate data. The goal is to predict house price per unit area based on features such as house age, proximity to MRT stations, number of convenience stores, and location.

## 🚀 Models Compared
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **R-squared (R²)**

### 🏆 Best Performing Model
**Linear Regression** — with the lowest MAE and highest R² on the test set.

## 🧪 Workflow
1. Data preprocessing (date conversion, scaling)
2. Train-test split (80-20)
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Performance comparison

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is a real estate dataset containing house features and prices.
